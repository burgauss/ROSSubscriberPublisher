First commit
The files contain are a typical ROS publisher and Subscriber architecture.
The only files that are planed to be modified are in the nodes folder and they are called
the subscriber.py and the publisher.py
The files are to be found inside the src\Nodes\...

*The code is planed to run inside the Raspberry PI architecture. So actually no compilation is avaialble
from this repository, moreover, some libraries only work inside the Raspberrypi.

If a code need to be updated inside the Raspberry, then we need to copy this files from the repo and
place them directly in the same folder inside the raspberry pi.
